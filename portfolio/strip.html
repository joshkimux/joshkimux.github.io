                            <h2>Year in review</h2>
                            <h3>Knowing is one thing, and feeling is another.</h3>
                            <p>This year I found myself wrestling more with my sense of identity, as most humans my age do, in hopes I could shorten the gap between knowing how I should feel and feeling what I think should feel.</p>
                            <p>For example, I <em>know</em> how to be present, but I can’t <em>feel</em> it in the way I think I should. I can curl my toes, hum a song, take a walk– but I often find any sense of presence to be transitory. It’s frustrating. It’s youth. Or capitalism. Or trauma.</p>
                            <p>Regardless, I have tried (and have continued to fail) to find concrete answers that I both know and feel to be true. Specifically on:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>who I should be (family), </li>
                                <li>who I need to be (society) and </li>
                                <li>who I want to be (true self)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>That’s not to say I didn’t make progress, if I can call it that. By progress, I think I mean deconstruction. But strip feels like a better word. It carries shame. Emotionally this process of unlearning has been raw and humiliating, but it has yielded progress nonetheless.</p>
                            <p>By stripping away who I should be over the last couple of years (by distancing myself from my birth family), I've found that my life goals were more of a chain reaction to intergenerational trauma than to my own self-actualization.</p>
                            <p>Although I still don’t know who I want to be (true self), I do feel I have more space and autonomy to imagine that future. I have a better grasp of personal values I can use to navigate day to day decisions.</p>
                            <p>To continue my journey this year, I focused more on stripping away who I need to be (society). For me, and many other Americans, that’s inseparable from our working identity.</p>
                            <p>So I tried to learn more about:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>what is the history of my work (as a designer and former consultant)</li>
                                <li>who am I within it and </li>
                                <li>who am I without it?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Can I love?</h3>
                            <p>I was able to deepen my understanding on how:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Colonization has shaped society’s understanding of work and community. For example, how the introduction of cattle slavery solidified disability as a physical category “centered on which bodies and minds have or generate economic value under taxing working conditions” (Against Technoableism).</li>
                                <li>Corporations are less about making and fixing things and more about “political processes of appropriating, distributing, and allocating money and resources” (Bullshit Jobs).</li>
                                <li>The consulting industry is preventing governments and businesses from “evolving the capabilities they need to transform our economies for the common good” (The Big Con). </li>
                                <li>Technological advances in design “only make some lives better” from the lens of decolonization. For example, the cotton gin lead to the nearly five-fold increase in slavery within a period of sixty years and the top-ten largest server farms take up 11.7 million square feet of stolen Indigenous lands (Decolonizing Design).</li>
                                <li>And more– but that’ll make this entry a bit too long.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Looking back on what I’ve learned, I sometimes wonder if I feel any sense of joy from my work anymore. For example, I had an interview earlier this year. I was asked what technologies or mobile app features I loved. </p>
                            <p>And I froze. </p>
                            <p>I could think of many technologies.</p>
                            <p>But can I love them? </p>
                            <p>How can I have pride in my identity as a designer when it's been crafted within systems that exploit, manipulate, and exclude people I love? How can I love technology when it is so deeply intertwined with incentives that divide us more than they bring us together?</p>
                            <p>To many reading this (myself included), this sounds reactionary. It is. </p>
                            <p>But as much as my brain understands that generalizations like this are deeply inactionable, I still find it difficult to maintain the energy to fight that instinct when our histories and futures continue to be muddy, complex, and hurtful.</p>
                            <p>So I’ll try to remind myself out loud what I think the answer to this is.</p>
                            <h3>I need to touch grass more. </h3>
                            <p>By touch grass, I mean to be in community. To study through people in groups (espresso), and not just books in isolation (depresso). Instead of conserving energy alone, I want to learn how to better receive, give, and grow it together with people I love. That means expending what little energy I have in my little corner of the universe to resist the systems designed to isolate and exploit us even more.</p>
                            <p>I think I’ve done that a little bit better this year. </p>
                            <p>As uncomfortable as it has been to strip apart a little more of my working identity and ego, it’s helped me to become more vulnerable, honest, interdependent, and caring as a mentor (thanks Tiff and Cath), mentee (thanks Rachael and Lydia), speaker (thanks Dave), and designer (all my VA a11y friends who I miss way too much, my portfolio pals, my Ad Hoc middle management buddies, DC design week friends, Evan and Daniel, and more). </p>
                            <p>While these values may be at odds with the work I’ve chosen, I’ve learned through emergent strategy that what I pay attention to will grow in fractals. Like fungi.</p>
                            <p>If I can focus on these values locally at a smaller scale, I hope one day they will emerge more sustainably as larger patterns in my life.</p>
                            <p>So next year I hope to ask for help more. To persist with vulnerability. To lose track of time and productivity if it's with others. To be loved.</p>
                            <p>If I can pay more attention towards who I am in a community and less towards who I need to be for work, maybe I’ll get a little closer to understanding who I want to be too.</p>

                            <h3>Talks or articles ya boi wants to manifest but can’t yet</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Advocates, not experts. The case for shame-sensitive accessibility practices. (Mostly to write about my experience managing and coaching accessibility specialists in large organizations).</li>
                                <li>A trauma-informed approach to design mentorship for Asian Americans or accessibility specialists. (I’d be interested in writing about my experiences with both and how to make use of assets-based mentorship, build competency constellations, and flatten power dynamics). </li>
                                <li>The swiss cheese model of accessibility testing. (I kinda wrote on this already at the VA, but it never got published… yet. Brian will, one day.)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Things I was proud of this year</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Looking back on my 3 years at the VA and Ad Hoc, for once in my life I feel like I’ve made an actual, measurable and positive difference. </li>
                                <li>I gave a talk with my good friend Dave at UVA on design ethics! If I was smarter and had money I’d love to go back to school to become qualified enough to do this full time.</li>
                                <li>I made a more conscious effort to prioritize my personal life over my work life (including a job change and two trips to visit my in-laws). It came with a ton of anxiety that my technical skills are rotting and I’ll never be employable again, but I did it. I took the step.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Things I boarded the struggle bus on</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I continue to love reading about stuff that makes me sad and will never support me financially.</li>
                                <li>I’ve been ghosted a couple of times in my search for a new therapist thanks to a new insurance plan.</li>
                                <li>When I needed it the most, I failed to reach out to my friends for personal, non-work related help. I was conditioned to be an asset, and that’s still hard to unlearn.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>My favorite reads in 2023</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Trauma stewardship. I was skeptical at first, but the author was just so darn human that all my cynicism melted away.</li>
                                <li>Emergent strategy. I finally feel I have an actual, non-corporate playbook for sustainable and loving transformation.</li>
                                <li>You deserve a tech union. Like damn, I actually feel I can form a union now. </li>

                            <figcaption>I hung up a poster of a farewell board some friends at VA made for me. It's been an affirming compass of sorts for me that I'm more than just what I produce. My cat hasn't attacked it. Yet.</figcaption>
