                <p>
                    Kristen moved to Falls Church as a consultant in a federal engineering contracting company located in Tysons Corner. Now that she has settled in, she is looking to find a new coffee shop to call her own and relax in after work. Kristen's perfect coffee shop would have plenty of space, some background noise, good aesthetics, and a friendly atmosphere with good coffee. Quality is more important to Kristen than the price, so she is more than happy to pay extra for a non-starbucks local brew. As she has enough to stress about at work, Kristen just wants to be able to sit down and read a book for an hour or two away from the hustle of her busy career. Outside of cafes, Kristen enjoys traveling to new countries and cities to explore and experience new cultures and moments.

                <p>
                    Maddy grew up in Northern Virginia, but only learned about De Clieu recently in her junior year of college when her project group decided to meet up somewhere off campus. She continued to come to the cafe for the background noise and coffee, but began making trips more often once the staff remembered her name and favorite orders. To Maddy, the atmosphere at De Clieu is everything- the employees, the people, and the music make the cafe something truly special in Fairfax. She will take her coffee to go if in a hurry, but prefers to stay for the atmosphere. Maddy likes ordering the honey charcoal latte and the seasonal specials while she studies on her macbook. She also will bring group project members and friends to the cafe to work together. In the future Maddy hopes to graduate with honors and get a job at a trendy marketing firm.</p>

                <p>Robert is a local business owner in Vienna. He knows how hard it is for local businesses to stay afloat, so he is passionate about supporting families that run them. Robert has been going to De Clieu for many years for this reason, but recently due to its popularity and crowds it's been harder to grab a seat. He is happily married, but struggles sometimes to find places to eat as she is vegetarian. Nothing is more important to Robert than a face to face conversation; he values the integrity of local word of mouth more than anything else. When he comes to De Clieu he likes ordering the lattes. Although he doesn't know much about the process, he trusts De Clieu will put in the extra effort to make sure his coffee is perfect. On the weekends he will often catch up with friends and co-workers at the cafe. Robert hopes to retire in the next ten years to spend more time with the people he loves.</p>
