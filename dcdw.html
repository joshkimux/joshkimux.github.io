                        <h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
                        <p>DC Design Week is a celebration of the DC, Maryland, and Virginia region’s creative community. Each year, a committee of volunteers collaborates with local designers, businesses, and organizations to host a variety of events showcasing the work, creativity, and relationships thriving in this area.</p>
                        <p>I first joined the DC Design Week team in 2020, and was impressed by their commitment to diversity– but like many other AIGA programs, their efforts towards accessibility needed some love. Notably:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>No accessibility statement existed for the conference</li>
                            <li>No methods existed to request for accommodations</li>
                            <li>Branding and visual design were prioritized over accessibility</li>
                            <li>There were 100+ accessibility issues including color contrast, headings, motion, focus, alt text, and more</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I also joined too late. Accessibility was already siloed and framed around remediation as our brand and website were already in the works.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <video controls loop muted>
                                <source src="img/dcdw/old-web.mov" type="video/mp4" alt="The 2020 website had a sharp black and green against white contrast with a twitchy video auto-playing on the homepage.">

I knew that if I wanted to make an impactful change, I would need to start more upstream before branding and development could take place.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        
                        <h2>Shifting accessibility left through culture, not remediation</h2>
                        <p>As an annual conference that is run by over 40 volunteers and usually hosts 20+ events, DC Design Week needed upstream cultural change within the community, not last minute remediations to inaccessible ticketing and events.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>You cannot put the blueberries into the muffin after it is cooked. This shows that you have to think about accessibility from the beginning, not after a website is already built. Another story is about ice cream cones. If you ignore your ice cream cone it gets very messy. In the same way, you cannot ignore accessibility until the end of the project.</p>
                            </blockquote>

                        </figure>

                        <p>In the next 2 years, I focused on embedding myself as early and as often as possible with volunteers as a partner (not an expert) to bake the blueberries (accessibility) into our muffin (process).</p>

                            <figcaption>In the beginning, I focused on education at scale. I designed talks and handouts for executive leadership, volunteers, and speakers from <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10KVEPRwLV0dNRfyXxEvsNgJIgevpm1KZRM_WXEILQBI/edit?usp=sharing">inclusive presentation tutorials</a> to <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ow1HaUCoY1ED_w64A222mbBeCj0K5v2SiTgmxccQhrI/edit?usp=sharing">alt text workshops</a>.</figcaption>

                            <figcaption>I gave accessibility updates on volunteer calls, hosted office hours, and set up slack spaces for async feedback.</figcaption>

                            <figcaption>To make accessibility sticky and replicable as a process for everyone, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bSeugPtQutymwIvIU7widoxZ5qu1zpJK5r7LKUptMFU/edit?usp=sharing">I created checklists</a> and worked with leadership to embed them within our timelines. I was intentional about framing accessibility beyond compliance as the default, regularly pointing to AAA criteria and inclusive best practices beyond the digital experience.</figcaption>

                            <figcaption>I also worked closely with our web team to design a framework for accessibility QA ahead of time.</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <h2>Honest and inclusive language</h2>
                        <p>I made it a priority to make our public content on accessibility as honest, transparent, and inclusive as possible.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="img/dcdw/statement.png" style="width:100%;" alt="When drafting our accessibility statement, I wrote a comment arguing for transparency." />
                            <figcaption>I worked with AIGA board members to <a href="https://dcdesignweek.org/accessibility/">publish a new global accessibility statement</a>. This included work to inform AIGA national of accessibility issues beyond our scope and transparent language acknowledging exclusion, how we plan to do better, and what methods exist to request accommodations.</figcaption>

                            <figcaption>I also drafted a template for local accessibility information for each event, which let our content writers note if locations were ADA accessible and had gender-neutral bathrooms. </figcaption>

                            <figcaption>Default slide templates for presenters across all 20+ events included accessibility information.</figcaption>

                            <figcaption>Given AIGA DC’s focus on diversity, I worked with the team to include race in our alt text. <a href="https://ux.shopify.com/the-case-for-describing-race-in-alternative-text-attributes-a093380634f2">My colleague Tolu wisely makes the case for race</a> noting, “writers of alt text hold power in shaping the experience and perception of screen-reader users.” </figcaption>

                        <h2>Accessibility-first design</h2>
                        <p>By 2022, I was able to build up a strong relationship with our design and web teams to focus on accessibility beyond compliance (and not remediation).</p>

                            <figcaption>From kickoff, I worked with our brand partner Brllnt to ensure decisions prioritized accessibility beyond compliance from our typography to our colors. I was excited to see <a href="https://www.brllnt.co/case-studies/dcdw22">they wrote about accessibility too in their blog post.</a></figcaption>

                            <figcaption>From the atomic level, we designed for material honesty including how we handled buttons vs. underlined action links.</figcaption>

                        <h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
                        <p>Working with AIGA DC has been a gift over these last couple of years. While we’ve made huge leaps in accessibility as a ragtag team of volunteers, I feel we’re only just getting started: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Issues remain to be resolved, or may not have been caught yet</li>
                                <li>AIGA national remains to be inaccessible, with little transparency on how they plan to better include disabled creatives (if at all)</li>
                                <li>We need to include more disabled people within our teams and collaborate closer with local disabled creative groups</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>Although this is my last year with the DC Design Week team, I’m confident that with good people and an accessibility-first culture, we’ll continue to reach new heights.</p>
