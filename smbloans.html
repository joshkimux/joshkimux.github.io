                        <p>I joined the US Digital Response's SMB Loans (Small Business Loans) team to volunteer time to help small business owners discover which programs they qualify for.</p>
                        <p>They made an eligibility checker for the government of New Jersey, but it was in need of some design improvements.</p>

                        <p>I suggested a transition to <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/05/better-form-design-one-thing-per-page/">one thing per page</a>. This would:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Reduce cognitive overload.</strong> Less questions per page means more space to provide hints, less height to scroll, easier error validation, and a sense of progression for the user.</li>
                            <li><strong>Improve flexibility.</strong> Providing questions one at a time allows us to branch questions. This reduces the amount of irrelevant questions and disabled states.</li>
                            <li><strong>Maximize accessibility.</strong> One thing per page is easier for screen-reader users to use and performs better on mobile devices.</li>

                        <h2 id="simpler-navigation">A less intrusive navigation</h2>
                        <p>The navigation went through many iterations before I had joined the project. These iterations included a link to a government partnership page, a link to a list of PPP providers, and a language selection dropdown.</p>

                        <figure class="picture-caption">
                            <img class="no-border" src="img/smbloans/navigations.png" style="width:100%;" alt="Three versions of the navigation. Each had different elements in the navbar. The first is a bright blue with a short blurb Built by USDR, a non-partisan effort to assist the US government. The second is a deep navy with four navigation items: where to apply, national lenders, regional lenders, and back to info page. The third is titled Business Assistant with the option to pick languages from a dropdown." />
                        </figure>

                        <p>However, having too much in our navigation posed the risk of users losing track of the flow mid-form.</p>

                        <figure class="picture-caption">
                            <img src="img/smbloans/nav-iteration.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="A bright blue top navigation titled Federal Loan Assistant with navigational links: PPP loans, government partners, and a language selection dropdown." />
                            <figcaption>Despite switching to one thing per page, the navigation was still a problem. Escape routes were accented due to the nav's background color.</figcaption>
                        </figure>


                        <p>I started by removing the government partnership and PPP providers list links. Small business owners are not government partners, and from our interviews we learned they didn't have the leisure to scroll through a long list of PPP providers.</p>
                        <p>By removing these links, I was able to open up more space for the language selection. <a href="https://www.fuckdropdowns.com/">Dropdowns suck</a>, so we placed those options directly into the navigation.</p>
                        <p>To build trust, I suggested swapping the default USDR logo out with the local government’s logo if a user accessed the form through one of our partner’s websites.</p>

                            <figcaption>A simpler navigation is a less intrusive one. Users are able to focus on the form more and escape routes less.</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>My time working with the SMB Loans team was truly rewarding. The pro bono volunteers I collaborated with were among the most gracious and talented people I’ve ever met. If you have time to spare, <a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/">consider volunteering too!</a></p>
