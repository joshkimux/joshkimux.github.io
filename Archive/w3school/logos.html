                    <h1>Making a Logo, the 5 Minute Guide</h1>
                    <p>Logos are alot easier than what most people make them out to be. I'm going to show you how to make one in 5 minutes with Microsoft Powerpoint.</p>
                </div><br/>
                
                <h1>The Obvious Truth, Please Read</h1><hr/>
                <p>Do you want a high quality logo that represents your business well within a couple of days?  Yea, that's not going to happen if you don't have the experience, and this brief tutorial won't teach you that.  This is for people who need a placeholder for a prototype, want something extremely basic and fast, or just don't have a budget/tools.  If that <i>doesn't apply to you</i> then go hire yourself a professional, like me for say $30 bucks or three lunches at Himalayan Curry.  You can email me at joshk@vt.edu, check out my work at <a href = "http://joshk94.github.io/">my github site here. </a>I'm pretty good at this stuff.</p>
                <p>If that <i>does apply to you</i> on the flip side, let's get started with our ratchet solution.</p><br/>
                
                
                <h1>1. Begin the Blitz</h1><hr/>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-4">
                        <img src = "img/flaticon.png" style = "width: 100%"/>
                        <img src = "img/flaticon2.png" style = "width: 100%"/>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-8">
                        <p>We got five minutes.  Start by going to <a href = "http://www.flaticon.com/">flaticon.com</a>.  In the search bar, let's look up "wine".  From there, pick anything that you fancy, be sure you copy the name of the guy/girl who made it- you'll have to credit them later on your website!</p>
                        <p>As you see here, I've selected Kirill's wine and food icon. Go ahead and download the PNG version of this into your computer, don't customize it and just select the largest size option.  Flaticon will give you a link to pop into our code later to credit the author, so make sure you save it!</p>

                        <p>Go to <a href = "http://www.dafont.com/">dafont</a>.  Find a font that fits your taste here that we'll use for our logo.  A good way to find things is via the sort menu at the top; I'm going to look under Fancy -> Retro.  Find a font you like, and download it; I went with Bellerose.</p>
                        <p>Go into the folder you downloaded the font at, right click it, and install it.</p>

                        <p>Hopefully you have the most recent version of powerpoint.  Open it up and insert your icon that you downloaded earlier.  Make a textbox right next to it with a large font size (I did 199) and select the font you chose earlier on dafont.  From there, right click both objects while holding ctrl, then right click the border, and select group -> group. Finally, right click the newly grouped logo and select "save as picture."</p>

                        <p>Wallah, you have a logo for your app!  You can split this logo apart by just using the icon if you need a square logo or just keep it in it's rectangular state otherwise.  I feel a little ashamed for making a tutorial like this as a graphic designer, but I genuinely hope this will help someone out there if you're desperate enough.</p>
                        <p>ProTip: you should probably add color to your logo; if you want to go the extra step, use an eyedropper tool to select the colors you're using in your theme and give your logo an overlay!  Doing this will go over our 5 minute tutorial, but if you need help with that, you can shoot me an email for help @ joshk@vt.edu</p>
