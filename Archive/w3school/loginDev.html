                    <h1>Building our Login Page</h1>
                    <p>Chances are, your users will need to login; let's build an easy one using the template that we have!</p>
                </div>
                <br/>
                
                <h1>Updating the Nav</h1><hr/>
                <p>As we did in the last section, we'll need to update our navigation first.  Hopefully you'll know how to handle this by now!  I've attached a screenshot of what it should look like below just in case you forgot.</p><br/>
                <img class = "img-responsive" src = "img/logdev1.png"/><br/>
                
                <h1>Inserting Our Logo</h1><hr/>
                <p>Hopefully you remember the beautiful logo you made earlier in this tutorial!  If you already have one, great, otherwise <a href = "logos.html">please backtrack here!</a></p>
                <p>To get us kicked off, pop your logo into your image folder (should be img -> logo.png/jpg/etc).</p>
                <p>Here's the easy part, since we're building a login page we won't need cards for the styling.  All you have to do is pop in your logo with a standard <code>img</code> tag.  Don't forget to make sure it's responsive too by inputting <code>style: "width: 100%"</code>.  I also went ahead and animated it too for some extra flair by appending on <code>class = "w3-animate-top"</code> on top.  <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_animate.asp">Psst, if you still need help with what animation to use, check this W3 tutorial out.</a></p><br/>
                <img class = "img-responsive" src = "img/logdev2.png"/><br/>
                
                <h1>Making a Login Form</h1><hr/>
                <p>W3.CSS provides a plethora of options to choose from when it comes to building a login page or any form in general.  <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_input.asp">You can check it out here!</a></p>
                <p>We'll start by building the structure of the form itself with <code>form class = "w3-container"></code>.  Depending on what you're using to pull/push data to/from the back end you may want to include a form action as well.  Since this tutorial is front-end based though, we won't go into that stuff.</p><br/>
                <img class = "img-responsive" src = "img/logdev3.png"/><br/>
                
                <p>For this project, we'll have a login comprised of two basic inputs: a username and a password.  The user will need to input both in order to get through, so let's make these validated!  Luckily, W3.CSS offers a nifty solution to that using their input class styling.  We're going to copy and paste their validation form into our own code like so.  <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryit.asp?filename=tryw3css_input_validating">I used the one from here.</a></p><br/>
                <img class = "img-responsive" src = "img/logdev4.png"/><br/>
                
                <p>Let's wrap things up with some nice looking buttons!  We'll need two for this: a LOGIN and a New User option.  To start, since we don't want our buttons to collide with one another, and they aren't necessarily a completely a different card/entity from the form we will break them up with the <code>w3-section</code> class.</p>
                
                <p>Within these sections we'll need to make our actual buttons.  <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryit.asp?filename=tryw3css_buttons_fullwidth">These full width buttons should do the trick.</a>  In order to differentiate them, we can adjust their sizing with the sizing classes inherently included in w3.  For our LOGIN let's pop on the <code>w3-xlarge</code> class and for our New User let's use the <code>w3-medium</code> class.  I also hope you remember the accent color you chose way back, as we'll be using that to give our buttons life on the screen.  I've added a <code>w3-light-green</code> class to both buttons to do so.</p><br/>

                <hr/>
