                <h1>What is rapid front end development?</h1>
                <p>Rapid front end development, otherwise known as client side development, is about producing websites or apps at a fast pace to deliver a UI customers can see and interact with directly.</p>
                <p>You might be wondering, what's the point? Without front end development, there is no steering wheel; users need a point of interraction to be able to take advantage of the functionalities provided by back-end devs. It is seen in virtually all online websites, webapps, and more!</p>
                <br/>

                <p>You are building a wine app that allows users to look up different kinds of wine, where to purchase them, and their general info.

            <h1>So what should we use?</h1>
            <hr/>
            <p>Looking at this project, we need to pump out a mobile app at a lightning pace to be able to finish this before the deadline. Let's compare our options.</p>
            <br/>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <img src="img/android.jpg" style="width: 100%" />
                    <hr/>
                    <h3>Android Studio</h3>
                    <p>Android Studio is the full package. If we decided to build this project from scratch on an android platform, this would be the ideal tool. In regards to a front end development standpoint, Android Studio provides an in-house GUI that connects directly with the back-end code. With debugging options, testing, and more it is the go to platform for app development.</p>
                    <p> On the flip-side, however, Android Studio is as it names suggest limited to Android mobile phone users. Building a app that can be used by Apple phones as well provides new challenges that can't be addressed through AS.  Also, chances are since you're probably a BIT major, you <i>also probably don't know how to code or won't have the time/resources to learn a new language</i>, in which case this probably never was an option in the first place.</p>

                    <img src="img/bootstrap.jpg" style="width: 100%" />
                    <hr/>
                    <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
                    <p>I love bootstrap. This website was built in bootstrap. Bootstrap makes start-up web dev simple, it provides a development kit that sets the foundation for your websites including javascript, stylesheets, and even html templates if you're that lazy. Furthermore, bootstrap is web/mobile friendly making it robust and versatile for both website and mobile app use.</p>
                    <p>Despite these advantages, bootstrap can take a little while to get used to. There's a fairly large amount of terminology to become familiar with and it's styling is defaulted to what you see on this page right now. Adding the color/personality to the page is very much a task that must be handled by the front end developer.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <img src="img/w3.jpg" style="width: 100%" />
                    <hr/>
                    <h3>W3.CSS</h3>
                    <p>If you know how to copy and paste, you'll know how to build a webapp within a couple of hours tops. W3.CSS is built with the intention of creating webapps within a matter of minutes (for most developers). Similar to bootstrap, W3.CSS is free to use and extremely robust with built-in responsiveness; on top of this, it also is efficiently small and well packaged.</p>
                    <p class="bg-primary" style="padding: 10px;">W3.CSS meets our project specs quite nicely as it's easy to learn, quick to build, and works excellently on mobile. Furthermore, unlike Android Studio this will work on iPhones as well! We will be developing with the intention of building a <i>mobile</i> webapp.</p>
