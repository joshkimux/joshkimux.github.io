                    <p>I had the amazing opportunity to share my experiences in HCI with an IS senior capstone class! Throughout the first half, I gave a lecture on digital etiquette along with a brief overview of user research and analysis. As the students were in the ideation phase of their projects, I facilitated a crazy 8's session in the second part and took the opportunity to explain the difference between ideation and prototyping!</p>

                    <p>I noticed over time I had many design books I had finished reading just sitting at home, collecting dust. Instead of letting them sit longer, I knew they could fulfill a greater purpose! At that moment, I knew I wanted to start a library at work. However, my plan was quick to hit some major roadblocks along the way.</p>
                    <p>I had originally put together an online trello board where people could "loan" a book from me within a digital space. Once they dragged a card into a "loaned" column, I could then personally deliver the book to their desk. When I floated this idea to our creative lead, it got shut down; I would not be able to use a public digital space to organize the library. Furthermore, it was difficult getting people to notice the library as I kept all the books on my desk.</p>
                    <p>Instead of giving up, I was hit with a moment of inspiration. Why not replicate the digital trello board physically in an open space? I set up the library in an accessible location within our studio, and conspicuously laid out a kanban board right next to it. Within a few days, the library took off!</p>
                    <p>I, along with my close work friend Jason, now maintain the library as book consultants (we give people book recommendations). We've successfully made the design library an interactive space within our studio, and it has now seen over thirty loans in its brief two month lifespan. It's also grown across competencies! Our DevOps team has jumped in with their own books, and we're looking to expand the space even more.</p>
