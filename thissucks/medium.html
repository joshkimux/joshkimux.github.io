                            <p>2020 in Review</p>
                            <h1>Medium</h1>
                            <p>I’m starting this out with a detour. The original title of this annual reflection was, “The Medium is the Massage.” It’s designer jargon for how our tools change how we see and interact with the world. I picked that phrase as the original title to discuss three personal lessons:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>My tools, skills, cognition, and workplace control how I design</strong> more than I can control them.</li>
                                <li><strong>I can regain some control back</strong> by studying my current tools more, widening my skillsets, exposing myself to new perspectives, actively checking my own biases, and changing environments (for example, switching jobs).</li>
                                <li><strong>I know more than ever before that I know very little</strong>, and that's a good thing. It's allowed me to reframe my imposter syndrome as something valuable in my work as a designer. It grounds me in my approach as a facilitator instead of an expert; as a team member and not a genius (which is dangerous for a number of reasons).</li>
                            </ul>  
                        </div>
                        <figure class="col-lg-10">
                            <img class="ft-img " src="../img/website/medium/old-draft.png" style="width:100%;" alt="My original iteration on google docs was titled the medium is the massage and was chalk full of designer jargon."/>
                        </figure>
                        <div class="col-lg-9 col-xl-8">
                            <p>I made these simple points more complicated than they had to be by writing my first draft like a design lecture outwards (to you, my reader) rather than a personal reflection inwards. I was trying to make myself sound smart-- which is ironic-- because the point I was trying to make was that I’m really not that smart at all. </p>
                            <p>Personal note. I started this reflection thing to remind myself of two points annually:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I must be critical of my perspective and shortcomings</li>
                                <li>There will always be something to improve on</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Had I published a paper instead of a genuine, open reflection, I would have failed... but at this point, I was kinda stuck. How might I reflect on my year without overcomplicating the task or the message?</p>
                            <h2>Conversation as an alternative</h2>
                            <p>Given that the act of publishing makes me deliberate my thoughts to death, I became interested in exploring a different kind of medium; specifically, conversation. Why?</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Conversations feel alot more natural to me than trying to write up an article</li>
                                <li>I can't edit out my thoughts or make myself sound smarter than I actually am</li>
                                <li>Conversations are a two way street; it ain't gonna work if one party treats it like a lecture</li>
                                <li>I was interested to see <em>how I reflect</em> would change in this context</li>
                                <li>Selfishly, I wanted an excuse to reach out to my good old friend and mentor Nerissa</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>And so I did! I invited Nerissa to join me on a podcast to reflect on our year, talk about our new jobs, compare inclusive cultures against toxic workplaces, and just about everything else in between.</p>

                            <h2>Portfolio redesign</h2>
                            <p>By redesign, I mean burning the old portfolio in a dumpster fire and starting afresh from zero. Improvements included:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A simple, semantic foundation</li>

                            <p>I've taken extra care to create a portfolio everyone can experience including skip links, logically ordered headings, and reduced motion for animations. For more, <a href="../accessibility.html">check out my accessibility statement</a>.</p>

                            <p>I've removed my old portfolio projects in favor of probono work, articles, talks, and a resume. I don't have the time to torture myself over new portfolio pieces.</p>

                            <h3>What's next?</h3>
                            <p>I'm far from satisfied with the end result. Although I'm not a front end engineer by trade, I want to learn more because I consider code as the raw material of the digital world. Designers who understand the materials they use are far more competent in their craft.</p>
                            <p>There's also still alot of work to be done to improve the accessibility of this website (accessibility work is never finished). I still haven't tested this on JAWS and NVDA (I need a windows computer) and there's a large amount of presentations and pdfs that require converting to a more inclusive format.</p>
                            <p>Finally, I want to do what all the cool kids are doing and switch over to 11ty so I can manage all this stuff easier. Maybe next year. Or the year after that.</p>
