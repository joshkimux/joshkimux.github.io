                            <p>2020 in Review</p>
                            <h1>Massage</h1>
                            <p><strong>2020 was an awakening.</strong></p>
                            <p>Through my growing awareness of the intersections of my studies, my work, and ongoing global crises- I have become more conscious and critical of how my tools, my skills, my cognition, and my working contexts strip me of my own autonomy. The consequences that exist thereafter, and my methods of mitigating them, will be the focus of this annual reflection.</p>
                            <p>As such, I'm naming this after a quote from Marshall Mcluhan's modern contemporary John M. Culkin:</p>
                            <figure>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us... These extensions of our senses begin to interact with our senses. These media become a massage.</p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <figcaption>John M. Culkin</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                        </div>
                        <figure class="col-lg-10">
                            <img class="ft-img " src="../img/website/massage/massage-ft.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="" />
                        </figure>
                        <div class="col-lg-9 col-xl-8">
                            <h2>The Medium is the Massage</h2>
                            <p>“Massage” was actually a typo of “message,” but Culkin insisted on keeping it as he believed it better represented how our various “mediums” (like our tools and technology) augment and influence our behavior.</p>
                            <p>To explain in more practical terms, let's examine Twitter.</p>
                            <p>Twitter’s purpose, according to @jack, is to steward “more healthy debate, conversations, and critical thinking.” You can <a href="https://www.cortico.ai/blog/2018/2/29/public-sphere-health-indicators">read more about this statement in Jack’s collaboration with Cortico</a> (which is MIA by the way).</p>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="../img/website/massage/twitter-3.png" alt=""/>
                                <figcaption>Twitter in 2018 vs Twitter in 2019</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <p>In application, those “healthy debates” emerge more frequently as free-for-all grease fires. With a 280 character limit and an algorithm that rewards reaction over introspection, Twitter as a medium can influence the content of our messages.</p>
                            <p>For more, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022243718815429">read this research paper on how Twitter’s character limit can influence emotional behavior</a>. It’s interesting to note that even the <em>type</em> of device (smartphone vs. PC) has an influence on our behavior.</p>
                            <h3>Tools in the design process</h3>
                            <p>We can apply this thought within the context of design work too. Let's examine the act of design synthesis as an example:</p>
                            <figure>
                                <blockquote cite="http://www.jonkolko.com/writingAbductiveThinking.php"><p>The physical limitation of the laptop (the size), combined with the digital limitations of the software (the organizational schema), dramatically limits the designers' ability to see the forest for the trees: they lose the ability to understand the research in totality and are limited in their ability to freely manipulate and associate individual pieces of data.</p></blockquote>
                                <figcaption>Jon Kolko</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <p>Our <em>technologies</em> can massage our sensemaking in research. Or consider the debate between Sketch and Figma:</p>
                            <figure>
                                <blockquote cite="https://kwokchain.com/2020/06/19/why-figma-wins/"><p>While Figma has been building the ideal tool for designers, they’ve actually built something more important: a way for non-designers to be involved in the design process.</p></blockquote> <figcaption>Kevin Kwok</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="https://i2.wp.com/kwokchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04.1-means-of-ascent-merged.png" alt=""/>
                                <figcaption>"now you’re all stuck inside the orange box with me"<br/> <cite>Kevin Kwok</cite></figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <p>Our technologies can also massage our team dynamics.</p>
                            <p><strong>We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us.</strong> I find this to be both fascinating and terrifying at once. What new insights, risks, and relationships could emerge if we were to simply shuffle our toolkits?</p>
                            <h3>Skill as a medium</h3>
                            <p>I think it’s also worth examining our <em>skills</em> as a medium that augments how we solve problems and perceive the world.</p>
                            <p>Consider how a UI designer trained in a print-focused Bauhaus curriculum would approach a design problem compared to a UX designer trained at a design thinking bootcamp. The former may spend arduous, methodical hours crafting a beautiful solution. The latter may be blitzing through sticky notes and prototypes to reach an MVP mobile app.</p>
                            <p>Both are likely to produce different solutions with unique consequences.</p>
                            <p>I started thinking about this more after reading Golden Krishna’s <cite>The Best Interface is No Interface</cite> where he discusses the problem of "lazy rectangles."</p>
                            <figure>
                                <blockquote cite="The Best Interface is No Interface"><p>When you specifically hire someone to generate UI, you won’t get new, innovative solutions. You’ll get more UI, not better UX.</p></blockquote> <figcaption>Golden Krishna</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <p>Hiring a UI designer (and most UX designers now a days) will lead to rectangles in a digital box. It's unfortunate because many problems in our world don't deserved to be reduced to pixels on a screen (if at all).</p>

                            
                            <h3>Cognition as a medium</h3>
                            
                            <h3>Workplace as a medium</h3>
                            
                            
                            
                            <h2>Auto-piloting into unintended consequences</h2>
                            <p>On that note, I often wonder about the unintended consequences UX/UI bootcamps may create by factory producing designers who are unconsciously indoctrinated to digital-app-based solutioning by their own limited, and hence, disabling skillsets.</p>
